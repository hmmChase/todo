## Refreshing Authentication

- On sign-in or sign-up, a long-lived Refresh JWT and short-lived Access JWT are generated by the Apollo server.
- The Refresh token is stored in a cookie.
- The Access token is included in the graphQL response.
- On the client, the Access token is stored in a global variable for subsequent requests.
- Using Apollo Client middleware, the Access token is validated before every request.
- If the Access token is expired, the middleware fetches a new one from the express server.
  - which validates the Refresh token before sending a new Access token.
- The Refresh token can be invalidated by incrementing the version.
  - This is done by making a graphQL request of:
    - mutation { revokeRefreshToken(id: "some-user-id") }
  - This will prevent the Access token from refreshing until the user signs in again.

## Getting Started

### Clone project

`git clone https://github.com/hmmChase/next-graphql-starter.git`

### Install dependencies

1. Navigate to project root `cd next-graphql-starter`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run frontend:install`
4. Run `npm run backend:install`

### Set environment variables

1. Locate `.env.example` in both `/frontend` and `/backend`
2. Make a copy of both
3. Rename copy to just `.env`

### Setup Prisma server

For simplicity's sake, we are using a demo server.

- First time
  - Visit [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and sign up
  - Install [CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-cli-and-configuration/using-the-prisma-cli-alx4/) and login

1. Navigate to `/backend`
2. Run `npm run deploy -- -n`
3. Select `Demo server`
4. Complete the prompts
5. Copy `HTTP` endpoint
6. Paste endpoint in `.env` as `PRISMA_ENDPOINT` value
7. Run `npm run schema`
   - Do this everytime you make a change to `datamodel.prisma`

### Setup Mailtrap

Can skip if you don't try to reset a password.

- First time
  - Visit [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io) and sign up
